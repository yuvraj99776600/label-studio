## Label Studio Enterprise 2.26.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Time series sync, new Multichannel tag for time series, spectrograms, playground 2.0, annotation result filtering</div>

*Jul 21, 2025*

Helm Chart version: [1.10.0](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/Chart.yaml)

### New features

#### Time series synchronization with audio and video

You can now use the sync parameter to align audio and video streams with time-series sensor data by mapping each frame to its corresponding timestamp.

For more information, see [Time Series Labeling with Audio and Video Synchronization](/templates/timeseries_audio_video).

<video style="max-width: 800px;" class="gif-border" autoplay loop muted>
  <source src="/images/releases/video-time-series-light.mp4">
</video>

#### Group multiple time series in one channel

There is a new [Multichannel tag](#MultiChannel) for visualizing time series data. You can use this tag to combine and view multiple time series channels simultaneously on a single channel, with synchronized interactions.

The Multichannel tag significantly improves the usability and correlation of time series data, making it easier for users to analyze and pinpoint relationships across different signals.

<video style="max-width: 800px;" class="gif-border" autoplay loop muted>
  <source src="/images/releases/timeline.mp4">
</video>


#### Spectrogram support for audio analysis

There is a new option to display audio files as spectrograms. You can further specify additional spectrogram settings such as windowing function, color scheme, dBs, mel bands, and more.

Spectrograms can provide a deeper level of audio analysis by visualizing frequency and amplitude over time, which is crucial for identifying subtle sounds (like voices or instruments) that might be missed with traditional waveform views.

![Image of spectrogram](/images/releases/spectrogram.png)

#### Playground 2.0

The [Label Studio Playground](https://labelstud.io/playground/) is an interactive sandbox where you can write or paste your XML labeling configuration and instantly preview it on sample tasks—no local install required.

The playground has recently been updated and improved, now supporting a wider range of features, including audio labeling. It is also now [a standalone app](https://labelstud.io/playground-app) and automatically stays in sync with the main application.

![Image of playground](/images/releases/2-26-playground1.png)

!!! info Tip
    To modify the data input, use a comment below the `<View>` tags:

    ![Image of playground](/images/releases/2-26-playground2.png)

#### Filter on annotation results

When applying filters, you will see new options that correspond to annotation results.

These options are identified by the results chip and correspond to control tag names and support complex filtering for multiple annotation results. For example, you can filter by “includes all” or “does not include.”

This enhancement provides a much more direct, predictable, and reliable way to filter and analyze annotation results, saving time and reducing the chances of errors previously encountered with regex matching.

For more information, see [Filter annotation results](#Filter-annotation-results).

![Image of filtering by results](/images/releases/2-26-results.png)

### Enhancements

#### Interactive view all

The **View All** feature when reviewing annotations has been improved so that you can now interact with all annotation elements side-by-side, making it easier to review annotations. For example, you can now play video and audio, move through timelines, and highlight regions.

<video style="max-width: 800px;" class="gif-border" autoplay loop muted>
  <source src="/images/releases/viewall.mp4">
</video>

#### Expanded email notifications

Users can now receive email notifications for various actions, including when they are invited to projects and workspaces, assigned tasks, and when a project is published or completed. You can opt out of notifications from the [Account & Settings page](user_account).

![Image of email options](/images/releases/2-26-email.png)

#### Support for JSONL and Parquet

Label Studio now supports more flexible JSON data import from cloud storage. When importing data, you can use JSONL format (where each line is a JSON object), and import Parquet files.

JSONL is the format needed for OpenAI fine-tuning, and the default format from Sagemaker and HuggingFace outputs. Parquet enables smoother data imports and exports for Enterprise-grade systems including Databricks, Snowflake, and AWS feature store,

This change simplifies data import for data scientists, aligns with common data storage practices, reduces manual data preparation steps, and improves efficiency by handling large, compressed data files (Parquet).

!!! note
    **Parquet support:** We do not support importing Parquet files that include predictions and/or annotations. 

#### Improved grid view configurability

You can now configure the following aspects of the Grid View in the Data Manager: 

- **Columns**
- **Fit images to width**

![Image of grid view](/images/releases/2-26-grid.png)

#### Usage & License page visibility

The **Billing & Usage** page has been renamed the **Usage & License** page. Previously this page was only visible to users in the Owner role. A read-only form of this page is now available to all users in the Admin role.

![Image of org page options](/images/releases/2-26-usage.png)

#### Enhanced control and visibility for storage proxies

There are two UI changes related to [storage proxies](#Pre-signed-URLs-vs-Storage-proxies):

- On the **Usage & License** page, a new **Enable Storage Proxy** toggle allows organization owners to disable proxying for all projects within the organization. When this setting is disabled, source storages must enable pre-signed URLs. If they are not enabled, the user will be shown an error when they try to add their source storage.
- On the **Source Storage** window, the toggle controlling whether you use pre-signed URLs now clearly indicates that OFF will enable proxying.

![Image of proxy options](/images/releases/2-26-proxy1.png)

![Image of proxy options](/images/releases/2-26-proxy2.png)

#### Enhanced delete actions from the Data Manager

When deleting annotations, reviews, or assignments, you can now select a specific user for the delete action. Previously, you were only able to delete all instances.

With this change, you will have more granular control over data deletion, allowing for precise management of reviews and annotations.

This enhancement is available for the following actions:

- **Delete Annotations**
- **Delete Reviews**
- **Delete Review Assignments**
- **Delete Annotator Assignments**

![Image of before and after](/images/releases/destructive-before-after.png)

#### Session timeout configuration

Organization owners can use the new **Session Timeout Policies** fields to control session timeout settings for all users within their organization. These fields are available from the **Usage & License** page.

Owners can configure both the maximum session age (total duration of a session) and the maximum time between activity (inactivity timeout).


#### Miscellaneous UX improvements

- Improved the message text seen when building templates using Ask AI.

- Improved the scrolling action for the workspace list, making it easier for orgs with very large workspace lists.

- Users on the Organization page are now sorted by email by default.

- The **Delete Annotator Assignments** action is now disabled when the tooltip is in automatic task distribution mode.

- The **Data Import** step has been redesigned to better reflect the drag and drop target. The text within the target has also been updated for accuracy and helpfulness.

    ![Image of import screen](/images/releases/2-26-import.png)
    
- The empty states of the labeling interface panels have been improved to provide user guidance and, where applicable, links to the documentation.

    ![Image of empty state panels](/images/releases/2-26-empty-state.png)

### Security

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.25.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Prompts on-prem availability, storage proxies, PDF tag, KeyPointLabels support, multi-task JSON imports for cloud</div>

*Jun 17, 2025*

Helm Chart version: [1.9.15](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/Chart.yaml)

### New features

#### Prompts availability for on-prem deployments

You can now configure your on-prem environment to use Prompts! 

Prompts is an interface to easily integrate LLMs into your own Label Studio deployment. Leading teams use it to pre-label data, compare models, and generate synthetic samples.

You can find out more here:

* [Prompts overview](prompts_overview)
* [Prompts product page](https://humansignal.com/platform/prompts/)
* [Blog - How to Generate Synthetic Data with Prompts in Label Studio](https://humansignal.com/blog/how-to-generate-synthetic-data-with-prompts-in-label-studio/)


Installing Prompts requires license enablement and [additional install steps](install_prompts). Reach out to your CSM to enable a free trial!

![Stylized image of Prompts](/images/releases/dog-prompts.png)

#### Storage proxies for cloud files

Label Studio now uses a proxy when accessing media files in connect cloud storages. For more information, see [Pre-signed URLs vs. storage proxies](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/storage#Pre-signed-URLs-vs-Storage-proxies).

Proxy mode is only used when the **Use pre-signed URLs** option is disabled in source storage.

Storage proxies offer secure media access, simplified configuration, and improved performance.

- Keeps data access within Label Studio's network boundary, ideal for on-premise environments
- Enforces strict task-level access control, even for cached files
- Eliminates the need for presigned URLs and CORS configuration
- Solves performance and reliability issues for large files, videos, and audio
- Media is now streamed via proxy, improving compatibility and scalability

#### New PDF tag

A [new PDF tag](/tags/pdf) lets you directly ingest PDF URLs for classification without needing to use hypertext tags.

This also simplifies the process for using PDFs with Prompts for summarization and classification tasks. 



### Enhancements

#### KeyPointLabels exports for COCO and YOLO

COCO and YOLO export formats now available for `KeyPointLabels`. For more information, see [our docs](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/export#COCO). 

#### Multi-task JSON imports for cloud

Previously, if you loaded JSON tasks from source storage, you could only configure one task per JSON file.

This restriction has been removed, and you can now specify multiple tasks per JSON file as long as all tasks follow the same format.

For more information, see the examples in our [our docs](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/storage#Off).


#### Miscellaneous

- The **Export Underlying Data** option was recently introduced and is available from the Annotations chart in the [annotator performance dashboard](dashboard_annotator). This allows you to export information about the tasks that the selected users have annotated. 

    Previously, users were only identified by user ID within the CSV. With this update, you can also identify users by email.

- User interface enhancements for the AI Assistant, including a new icon.


### Bug fixes

- Fixed various user interface issues associated with the new dark mode feature.

- Fixed an issue where the **Not Activated** role was hidden by default on the Organization page.

- Fixed several small issues related to the annotator agreement score popover.

- Fixed an issue where when moving around panels in the labeling interface, groups were not sticking in place.

- Fixed an issue where the token refresh function was not using the user-supplied `httpx_client`.

- Fixed an issue with cloud storage in which tasks would not resolve correctly if they referenced data in different buckets.

- Fixed an issue where the drop-down menu to select a user role was overflowing past the page edge.

     A comma-separated list of Origin header values the Label Studio server will receive, e.g. `https://example.org,https://example.net`

    - `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES`  
      Same as above, except using regex. 
    - `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`  
        Set to `false` or `0` to reject all Origin header values (that is, allow no cross-origin requests). By default this is set to `true`.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.23.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Google Cloud Storage WIF, drag-and-drop for video timelines, multiple security enhancements</div>

*Apr 22, 2025*

Helm Chart version: 1.9.9

### New features

#### Support for Google Cloud Storage Workload Identity Federation (WIF)

When adding project storage, you now have the option to choose Google Cloud Storage WIF.

Unlike the the standard GCS connection using application credentials, this allows Label Studio to request temporary credentials when connecting to your storage.

For more information, see [Google Cloud Storage with Workload Identity Federation (WIF)](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/storage#Google-Cloud-Storage-with-Workload-Identity-Federation-WIF).

![Screenshot of WIF](/images/releases/2-23-wif.png)

!!! note
    While this option is available for on-prem users, the typical way to set up GCS in an on-prem environment is through persistent storage as documented [here](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/persistent_storage.html#Configure-the-GCS-bucket). 


### Enhancements

#### Drag-and-drop adjustment for video timeline segments

You can now drag and drop to adjust the length of video timeline segments.

![Screenshot of video timeline](/images/releases/2-23-drag-drop.png)

#### "Custom Scripts" are now "Plugins"

We have renamed "Custom Scripts" to "Plugins." This is reflected in the UI and [in our docs](/plugins).

![Screenshot of video timeline](/images/releases/2-23-plugins.png)

#### Miscellaneous

- Improved tooltips related to [pausing annotators](quality).

- Ensured that when a user is deactivated, they are also automatically logged out. Previously they lost all access, but were not automatically logged out of active sessions.

- Multiple performance improvements for our [AI Assistant](ask_ai).


### Security

- Made security improvements around the verbosity of certain API calls.

- Made security improvements around SAML.

- Made security improvements around project parameter validation.

- Made security improvements around exception error messages.

- Made security improvements around workspace permission checks.


### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where importing from the UI would fail when importing from a URL.

- Fixed an issue where users were unable to edit custom agreement metrics if using manual distribution mode.

- Fixed an issue where regions would be added to the wrong task when moving quickly between tasks.

- Fixed an issue where **Exact frames matching for video** was always showing as an option for agreement metrics regardless of whether the labeling config referenced a video.

- Fixed an issue where the `prediction-changed` value was not being reset after making manual changes to pre-annotations.

- Fixed an issue where a paused annotator is unpaused when a reviewer rejects their annotation and the project is configured to requeue tasks back to the annotator.

- Fixed an issue where some segments were not previewable when annotating videos with the TimeLineLabels tag.

- Fixed several small issues with how labeled regions appear when completing OCR tasks.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.21.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Bulk labeling, enable AI features, and multiple labeling and Data Manager enhancements</div>

*Feb 25, 2025*

Helm Chart version: 1.9.5


### New features

#### Bulk labeling and image preview 

There is a new **Bulk label** action available from the Data Manager. You can use this to quickly label tasks multiple tasks at once.

This feature also includes enhancements to the Grid View in the Data Manager. Now when viewing images, you can zoom in/out, scroll, and pan.

For more information, see the [Bulk labeling documentation](labeling_bulk) and [Bulk Labeling: How to Classify in Batches](https://humansignal.com/blog/bulk-labeling-how-to-classify-in-batches/).

![Screenshot of bulk label action](/images/releases/2-21-bulk-label.png)

![Screenshot of Grid View preview](/images/releases/2-21-data-preview.png)

#### Enable AI features

There is a new toggle on the **Billing & Usage** page (only available to users in the Owner role). You can use this to enable [AI features](ask_ai) throughout Label Studio. 

![Screenshot of enable AI](/images/releases/2-21-ai-enable.png)

![Screenshot of AI banner](/images/releases/2-21-ai.png)


### Enhancements

#### Updated Billing & Usage page

The **Billing & Usage** page (only accessible to users in the Owner role) has several new options:

- **Early Adopter** - Opt in to new features before they're generally available.
- **Enable AI Features** - Enables AI helper tools within Label Studio. See [AI features](ask_ai).
- **White labeling** - Contact sales about enabling white labeling.
- **Custom Scripts** - Contact sales to enable custom scripts. See [Custom scripts for projects](scripts).

#### Updated template images

The thumbnail images for the pre-built templates have been redesigned.

![Screenshot of template library](/images/releases/2-21-templates.png)

#### Clearer description of annotation count

The annotation counter at the bottom of the Data Manager has been updated to read "Submitted Annotations." It previously read "Annotations," which could cause confusion.

![Screenshot of counter](/images/releases/2-21-count.png)

#### Display the prediction score in the labeling interface

When you have annotations generated by predictions (pre-annotations), you will now see the prediction score (also known as the "confidence score") under the model name in the labeling interface tabs.

![Screenshot of scores](/images/releases/2-21-score.png)

#### Region number in Relations panel

The **Relations** panel now displays the number identifier for the region when viewing relations between regions.

![Screenshot of region IDs](/images/releases/2-21-regions.png)

#### Export images with YOLO, YOLO_OBB, and COCO

Previously, when exporting data in YOLO, YOLO_OBB, or COCO format, the images themselves were not included in the export. 

To improve this, we have introduced three new choices to the export options:

* **YOLO_WITH_IMAGES**

* **YOLO_OBB_WITH_IMAGES**

* **COCO_WITH_IMAGES**

#### Set ground truths by user

There is a new action from the Data Manager that allows you to mark the annotations submitted by a specific user as ground truth annotations.  

![Screenshot of ground truths](/images/releases/2-21-gt.png)

![Screenshot of ground truths](/images/releases/2-21-gt2.png)

#### Control login redirects

There is a new `LOGIN_PAGE_URL` variable will redirect the login page to the URL specified in the variable. This is useful for organizations with that have white labeling enabled and/or multiple internal groups that have different IdP provider logins (or no IdP provider login).   

#### Performance improvements

Various performance improvements around Members page load time, annotation creation, and memory usage for Image tags. 

### Security

- Updated Iodash to address security vulnerabilities.

- Ensured that file paths remain hidden when import operations fail.

### Bug fixes

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.20.1

<div class="onprem-highlight">Security-related fixes</div>

*Feb 12, 2025*

Helm Chart version: 1.9.2

### Security

- Image file paths are restricted as to prevent arbitrary path traversal. 
- As an XSS prevention measure, `/projects/upload-example` no longer accepts GET requests.
- Only recognized S3 endpoints from a list of known S3 API providers will return full list exceptions when an HTTP call is submitted.

!!! note
    If you want to use a non-standard/custom domain for hosting your S3 API and you still want full exceptions to be visible, you can add your domain to the `S3_TRUSTED_STORAGE_DOMAINS` environment variable.

    Separate multiple domains with a comma. For example, if the endpoints you are using are `https://foo.mys3endpoint.net` and `https://myothers3endpoint.biz`, then you would set it as: 
    
    `S3_TRUSTED_STORAGE_DOMAINS=mys3endpoint.net,myothers3endpoint.biz`

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.19.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Paginated multi-image labeling and a new Task Reservation setting </div>

*Dec 17, 2024*

Helm Chart version: 1.7.3

### New features

#### Paginated multi-image labeling

Paginated multi-image labeling allows you to label an album of images within a single task. When enabled, a page navigation tool is available within the labeling interface. 

While you can use paginated multi-image labeling with any series of related images, it can also be especially useful for for document annotation. 

For example, you can pre-process a PDF to convert it into image files, and then use the pagination toolbar to navigate the PDF. For more information, see our [Multi-Page Document Annotation template](/templates/multi-page-document-annotation).

To enable this feature, use the `valueList` parameter on the [`<Image> tag`](/tags/image).

![Screenshot of multi-page annotation](/images/releases/2-19-mig.png)

#### Set task reservation time

There is a new project setting under **Annotation > Task Reservation**.

You can use this setting to determine how many minutes a task can be reserved by a user. You can also use it for projects that have become stalled due to too many reserved tasks. For more information, see [Project settings - Task Reservation](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/project_settings_lse#lock-tasks).

By default, the task reservation time is set to one day (1440 minutes). This setting is only available when task distribution is set to **Auto**.

![Screenshot of multi-page annotation](/images/releases/2-19-reservation.png)

### Enhancements

- When using the **Send Test Request** action for a connected ML backend model, you will now see more descriptive error messages.

- The placeholder text within labeling configuration previews is now more descriptive of what should appear, rather than providing example text strings.

- Improved the inter-annotator agreement API so that it is more performant and can better handle a high number of annotators.

- Improved Annotator Performance Report page load time.

- TextArea elements have been updated to reflect the look and feel of other labeling elements.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where SSO/SAML users were not being redirected back to the originally requested URL.

- Fixed an issue where a timeout on the inter-annotator agreement API would cause missing data in the Annotator Summary table on the Members page.

- Fixed an issue where the default date format used when exporting to CSV was incompatible with Google Sheets.

- Fixed an issue where commas in comment text breaking were causing errors when exporting to CSV from the Annotator Performance report.

- Fixed an issue that was causing 404 errors in the Activity Log.

- Fixed an issue where users were unable to deselect tools from the toolbar by clicking them a second time.

- Fixed an issue where users were presented with Reviewer actions even if the annotation was still in Draft state.

- Fixed an issue with the Source Storage editor in which some fields were overlapping in the user interface.

- Fixed an issue with the Data Manager filters when the columns are different from those in the labeling config and when `$undefined$` is present in the task data.

- Fixed an issue where filter options in the Data Manager would disappear on hover.

- Fixed an issue which caused XML comments to incorrectly be considered in the label config validation.

- Fixed an issue causing an error when marking a comment as read.

- Fixed an issue where an error message would appear when selecting or unselecting the **Get the latest news & tips from Heidi** option on the Account Settings page.

- Fixed an issue where annotators were seeing a tooltip message stating that the project was not ready yet, even though the project had already been completed.

- Fixed an issue where project-level roles did not affect role upgrades performed at the Organization level.


### Feature flag updates

The following feature flags have been removed:

- `fflag_feat_front_dev_2984_dm_draggable_columns_short`
- `fflag-feat-front-dev-2982-label-weights-settings`
- `ff_back_2070_inner_id_12052022_short`

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.18.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Link comments to fields, export information from the Annotator Performance dashboard </div>

*Nov 19, 2024*

Helm Chart version: 1.7.1

### New features

#### Link comments to fields

You can now link comments to specific regions or fields within an annotation.

This change will help improve clarity between Annotators and Reviewers, enhancing the quality review process.

For more information, see [Comments and notifications](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/comments_notifications).

![Screenshot of comment linking](/images/releases/2-18-comments1.png)

![Screenshot of comment linking](/images/releases/2-18-comments2.png)

#### Export information from the Annotator Performance dashboard

There is a new **Export** action available from the [Annotator Performance dashboard.](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/dashboard_annotator)

- **Report** - Download the information in the dashboard as CSV or JSON.
- **Timeline** - Download a detailed timeline of all the user's annotation actions within the timeframe, including when the began and submitted each annotation.
- **Comments Received** - Download a CSV file with all of the comments that other users have left on the user's annotations.

![Screenshot of export action](/images/releases/2-18-export.png)

### Enhancements

#### Performance score added to the Annotator Performance dashboard

A **Performance Score** metric has been added to the Annotator Performance dashboard metrics. This reflects the overall performance of annotators in terms of review actions (**Accept**, **Reject**, **Fix+Accept**). For more information, see [Performance summaries](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/dashboard_annotator#Performance-summaries). 

![Screenshot of Performance Score metric](/images/releases/2-18-score.png)

#### Edit regions when classifying video frames

We recently introduced the ability to perform [video frame classification](https://docs.humansignal.com/templates/video_frame_classification) with the `<TimelineLabels>` tag.

You now have the ability to edit the frame spans you select in the timeline editor, making it easier to control which frames you want to label.

![Screenshot of edit action](/images/releases/2-18-edit.png)

#### Improved usability on project settings pages

There are a number of [project settings](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/project_settings_lse) that are only applicable when auto distribution is enabled for users.

To prevent confusion, settings that are not applicable will be hidden when manual distribution is enabled.

This means the following settings will be hidden when **Annotation > Distribute Labeling Tasks** is set to **Manual**:

- **Annotation > Task Sampling**
- **Quality > Overlap of Annotations**
- **Quality > Low Agreement Strategy**

#### Hotkey to show/hide all regions

A new hotkey (**Ctrl + h**) has been added. Use this shortcut to hide all regions. Or, if no regions are visible, show all regions.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where users were shown a 500 error when attempting to create a project without first selecting a workspace.

- Fixed an issue where in certain scenarios users were unable to receive a password reset email.

- Fixed a small UI issue seen when displaying drop-down menus with multiple nested selection options.

- Fixed an issue where deleting reviews did not clear cancelled values from the Data Manager.

- Fixed an issue where the **Allow reviewer to choose: Requeue or Remove** setting could cause the Label All Tasks action to be enabled for annotators when there were no tasks to label.

- Fixed an issue where instructions were not visible to reviewers in the Review Stream.

- Fixed an issue in which SMTP configuration was not working correctly despite passing initial tests.

- Fixed an issue where deleted annotator users were not available as option when building filters in the Data Manager.

- Fixed an issue that could produce duplicate accounts when synced from SCIM.

- Fixed an issue where the application would crash when annotators who have also had a project role of Reviewer would navigate to the Data Manager.

- Fixed an issue where users were getting errors if using Redis passwords that included special characters.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.17.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">New reviewer workflow options, streamlined layout for the Projects page, and other UI improvements </div>

*Oct 22, 2024*

Helm Chart version: 1.6.3

### New features

#### Allow Reviewers to either requeue or reject annotations

There is a new option on the **Review** page of the project settings: **Allow reviewer to choose: Requeue or Remove**.

When enabled, reviewers will see two reject options for an annotation: **Remove** (reject and remove the annotation from the queue) and **Requeue** (reject and then requeue the annotation).

This is useful for situations in which some annotations are incorrect or incomplete, but are acceptable with some fixes. In those cases, it may be more useful to send the task back to the annotator. In other cases, where the annotation is far from correct, it is better to remove it entirely. 

For more information, see [Project settings - Review](#Review).

![Screenshot of reject setting options](/images/releases/2_17_0_review_settings.png)

![Screenshot of reject actions](/images/releases/2_17_0_review_actions.png)

- The Projects page header has been updated with a more compact design:
    - The search bar, projects drop-down menu, and create actions have all been consolidated onto one line.
    - The **Use Template** action has been moved and is now available as a drop-down option within the **Create Project** button.
    - The **Use Template** action has also been renamed **Create from saved template**.

   ![Screenshot of project page](/images/releases/2_17_0_project_page.png) 
- For better clarity, the Sandbox workspace has been renamed **Personal Sandbox**.
- You will now see a progress bar when performing searches against the activity log to indicate that the search is still processing.
- When creating regions that have start and end times (such as when annotating sections of an audio track), you will now see the duration of your selection under the **Info** tab.
    ![Screenshot of duration info](/images/releases/2_17_0_duration.png)

### Bug fixes

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.15.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Reviewer workflow updates, drag-and-drop tab reordering, usability enhancements for the <b>Show region labels</b> option, and upgrading to Django 4.2 </div>

*Sep 03, 2024*

Helm Chart version: 1.6.3

### Enhancements

- The reviewer workflow has changed to be more user-friendly and intuitive. As part of this enhancement, you will see the following changes:
    - If you are a Reviewer, Manager, Admin, or Owner and you click a task in the Data Manager, you will now see the reviewer actions (**Accept, Reject, Fix+Accept**) instead of the **Update** action. Going forward, only the user who created the annotation will see the **Update** action.
    - The **Explore All Reviews** option is no longer available. This is because the same basic functionality is now available by simply selecting tasks in the Data Manager.
    - When you click **Review All Tasks**, by default you will now be shown tasks in the same order in which the annotator completed their tasks. Previously, you were shown tasks in reverse order from completion.

   For more information, see [Improvements to HumanSignal Reviewer Workflow](https://humansignal.com/blog/improvements-to-humansignal-reviewer-workflow/). 

* You can now reorder tabs in the Data Manager by dragging and dropping them.

    ![Gif of reordering tabs](/images/releases/2-15-drag-and-drop.gif)

* When viewing regions with the **Show region labels** option enabled, the region label will now include the same index identifier that you see in the regions list. 

    Before:

    ![Screenshot of label regions before](/images/releases/2-15-label-after.png)

    After:

    ![Screenshot of label regions after](/images/releases/2-15-label-before.png)

* When you make changes to the labeling configuration and attempt to navigate away before leaving, you will now see a warning message prompting you to save your changes. 

    ![Screenshot of warning message](/images/releases/2-15-unsaved-changes.png)

* When using the Annotator Performance Reports, you can now select whether you want to aggregate data by Creation Date or Updated Date. 

    ![Screenshot of warning message](/images/releases/2-15-performance-report.png)

* There is a new Performance Score column on the project Members page:

    The Performance Score column reflects the overall performance of annotators. This score takes into account all review actions, including annotations that were initially rejected and later accepted. The calculation is as follows:
    - Each annotation review action (accept, reject, fix+accept) contributes to the score.
    - The score is calculated by summing the scores of all review actions and dividing by the total number of review actions.
    For example:
    - If an annotation is rejected twice and then accepted once, the Performance Score would be (0 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 33%.
    - If an annotation is rejected once and then fixed+accepted with a score of 42%, the Performance Score would be (0 + 0.42) / 2 = 21%.

    This is different from the Review Score, which only reflects the current accepted/rejected state of annotations.

    ![Screenshot of performance score](/images/releases/2-15-performance-score.png)

* There is now a link to the HumanSignal support portal available from the menu. You can find FAQ and troubleshooting information here, as well as a link to open a support ticket.  

    ![Screenshot of warning message](/images/releases/2-15-support-link.png)

### Breaking changes

- This release includes an upgrade to Django 4.2. As a result, PostgreSQL 11 is no longer support. Before upgrading, you must migrate to PostresSQL 12 or later.

### Security

Upgraded NLTK to 3.9.1 to address [CVE-2024-39705](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39705). 

### Feature flag updates

The following feature flags have been removed:

- `fflag_feat_front_prod_e_111_annotator_workflow_control_short`
- `fflag_fix_front_lsdv_4673_rect3point_relative_310523_short`
- `ff_back_1614_rejected_queue_17022022_short`

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the View all annotations action was not working when the `<Text>` tag value was empty.

- Fixed an issue where Annotators were not seeing comments when assigned to the Reviewer role on the project-level.

- Fixed an issue with agreement scores for Annotators being inaccurately calculated on the Members page within projects. This issue would appear when a Reviewer would reject an annotation and then later accept it.

- Fixed an issue with displaying large integer numbers in the Data Manager.

- Fixed an issue with breaking Text/HyperText content that contains emoji when regions are added.

- Fixed an issue with tooltips that was causing errors in the transition effects.

- Fixed an issue where workspaces could be deleted through the API even if they still contained projects.

- Fixed an issue where users were seeing an error when visiting the Annotator Performance Report page without first selecting a user. Instead, users should be redirected away from the page until a user is selected.

- Fixed usability issues seen in the Members table once the member user list grows large enough.

- Fixed an issue where users were seeing a runtime error when loading the dashboard in situations in which the project’s labeling configuration did not include labels.

- Fixed an issue where tracing was breaking presigned URL requests.

- Fixed an issue where the Project dashboard was returning an error.

- Fixed an issue where, when attempting to select multiple bounding boxes by pressing Command (or Ctrl), a new bounding box would be created instead.

- Fixed an issue where the project summary was not being included when duplicating a project.

- Fixed an issue where images were improperly resizing after loading due to how the original dimensions were set.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.13.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Annotator performance dashboards, potential breaking change for Google Cloud Storage users, feature flag changes</div>

*Jul 02, 2024*

Helm Chart version: 1.4.9

### New features

#### Annotator performance dashboards - Beta

With this release, you will see a new **Performance report** action available from the Organization page. 

![Screenshot of Performance Report button](/images/project/user_report.png)

Clicking this takes you to a dashboard focused on annotator performance. This new dashboard is designed to help you manage your team, figure out resource allocation, and save the expense of building custom internal tracking tools.

![Screenshot of the annotator dashboard](/images/releases/2-13-annotator-report.png)

The annotator performance dashboard provides insight into each user’s annotation activity over a period of time. You can see how much time they spent annotating, how many annotations they submitted, and their average time spent per annotation. You can further refine this dashboard by workspace and project. 

For more information, see [Annotator performance dashboard](dashboard_annotator) and [Annotator Dashboard Helps Optimize Team Performance](https://humansignal.com/blog/new-annotator-dashboard-helps-optimize-team-performance/).

### Enhancements

Improved performance on the Projects list page due to improvement on the API level.


### Breaking changes

- Fixed an issue with Google Cloud Storage when the connection has the **Use pre-signed URLs** option disabled. In these situations, Google was sending pre-signed URLs with the format `https://storage.googleapis.com` rather than sending BLOBs.

    With this fix, Google Cloud Storage will begin returning BLOBs/base64 encoded data when **Use pre-signed URLs** is off. This means that Label Studio will start reading data from Google Cloud Storage buckets, which can result in large amounts of data being sent to your Label Studio instance - potentially affecting performance.

### Feature flag changes

- As part of an ongoing effort to streamline our codebase, we have identified a number of seldom-used feature flags. We have marked these feature flags as `stale`, meaning they can no longer be enabled by users. For a full list of all affected feature flags, see https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/pull/5971

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue with Redis being unable to connect to SSL.
- Fixed an issue where Redis storage connections were causing errors due to a missing field in the storage form (Storage Title).
- Fixed an issue where connected ML backends were unable to return more than one prediction per task.
- Fixed an issue where annotators were not being prompted to leave a comment when skipping a task, even though the project settings required them to do so.
- Fixed an issue where sometimes actual usernames were being replaced by a generic “Admin” username in the annotation history.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.12.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">New experimental Cache Labels action in the Data Manager, annotation history in snapshots, new setting to restrict local imports into Label Studio, and changes to how the Hide Storage Settings for Manager environment variable works. </div>

*Jun 04, 2024*

Helm Chart version: 1.4.8


### Enhancements

- There is a new experimental **Cache Labels** action available from the Data Manager. This action extracts labels from annotations or predictions and compiles that information into a new column in the Data Manager. You can then use this column for faster searching and filtering.

    To enable experimental features, set the `EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` environment variable to `True`. However, note that experimental features are not fully supported.
- When you create a new snapshot, you will now have the option to include annotation history:

    ![Screenshot of the snapshot dialog](/images/releases/2_12_snapshot.png)
- There is a new setting that can restrict users from uploading data directly to Label Studio, forcing them to only use cloud storage. If you would like to enable this setting, set the `DISABLE_PROJECT_IMPORTS` environment variable to `True`.
- For organizations with the  `HIDE_STORAGE_SETTINGS_FOR_MANAGER` environment variable set to `True`, Managers will now be able to sync data from external storage as necessary rather than request assistance from an Admin user.

### Security

- Updated xml2js and Babel to avoid a vulnerabilities found in earlier versions.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue in which users were allowed to submit empty annotations when using hotkeys, even though empty annotations were disabled via the **Allow empty annotations** project setting. 

- Fixed an issue with button sizing inconsistency when selecting date ranges.

- Fixed an issue where regions were disappearing when a user would switch between annotations and predictions.

- Fixed an issue that prevented users from fetching the URL for TimeSeries objects.

- Fixed an issue where, if there was no name provided for a cloud storage connection, the project settings page would not load.

- Fixed an issue with environment variables that have the prefix `LABEL_STUDIO_` appearing in context logs.

- Fixed an issue where errors were appearing in the user console related to loading large JS files.

- Fixed an issue in which users who have their own organization could not be added to another organization using SCIM.

- Fixed an issue where SCIM was not handling adding or disabling users in situations where the user limit was exceeded.

- Fixed an issue where SCIM was creating duplicate users in situations in which there were discrepancies in casing used in their domain names.

- Fixed an issue where logs were failing because the default level was set to `DEBUG`. The default log level is now `INFO`.

- Fixed an issue in which the **Start Training** action for ML backends was sending the `PROJECT_UPDATE` webhook event instead of `START_TRAINING`.

- Fixed an issue where the **Batch Predictions** action was failing under certain conditions.

- Fixed an issue where tooltips on the dashboard were causing confusing mouseover behavior even when not visible.

- Fixed an issue where multiple errors would appear in the console when users navigated away from the Data Manager.

- Fixed an issue where the progress bar for projects was not properly accounting for tasks that required additional annotators due to low agreement settings.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.11.1

<div class="onprem-highlight">Improved machine learning & LLM integrations, action to remove duplicated tasks, Redis ACL support, and other enhancements and bug fixes</div>

*Apr 30, 2024*

Helm Chart version: 1.4.4

### New features 

#### Improved machine learning & LLM integrations

This release streamlines the way ML models and LLMs are connected to Label Studio with a focus on security and simplified user experience. 

Using the powerful ML backend integration, users can add models and customize automated workflows for:

- **Pre-labeling**: Letting ML/AI models predict labels autonomously, which can then be reviewed by human annotators.
- **Interactive labeling**: An automated process that applies initial labels to data, which are then refined through manual review, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of data annotation for machine learning models.
- **Model evaluation and fine-tuning**: Used in models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), involves a human-in-the-loop approach where the model provides initial predictions or annotations, and a human annotator interacts directly with these predictions to correct or refine them.

Label Studio Enterprise users can add custom models, or reference a [new examples library](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-ml-backend/tree/master) to connect popular models, including Segment Anything, OpenAI, Grounding DINO, select Hugging Face models, Tesseract, and more.

Updates to the ML backend integration in this release include:

- New support for basic auth, which means users can now connect to hosted ML backends that require a password.
- The ability to specify additional parameters to pass to the model, which means users can now easily connect to Azure-hosted OpenAI in addition to OpenAI and popular ML models.
- An improved UI and simplified project settings, including:
    - A new **Live Predictions** section under the **Annotation** page of the project settings makes it easier select whether you want to use predictions or a model in your annotation workflow.
    - A new **Predictions** page, where you can easily upload and manage predictions.
    - Removed obsolete settings that are no longer compatible (for example, auto-updating version).
    - Fixed various usability issues related to the annotation experience with a model connected.

For more information, see [Integrate Label Studio into your machine learning pipeline](ml).

![Screenshot of the new ML backend screens](/images/releases/2-11-0-ml-backend.png)


#### Remove Duplicated Tasks action

There is a new Remove Duplicated Tasks action available from the Data Manager. This action had previously only been available as an experimental feature.  

When you use this action, annotations from duplicated tasks are consolidated into one task (the first task found among the duplicated tasks). 

![Screenshot of the Remove Duplicated Tasks action](/images/releases/2-11-1-remove-duplicate.png)


### Enhancements

- Redis ACLs are now supported.

- Improved usability for project dashboards by changing how time filtering works to more accurately reflect annotation progress.

- Multiple domains per organization are now supported for SSO login.


### Security

- Enhanced validation to ensure that projects created through the API have workspaces within the active organization.

- Fixed an issue in which insufficient permission checks were performed for certain API calls.


### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where, during the review process, the mouse cursor would disappear against light gray backgrounds.

- Fixed an issue where some tasks were not displayed when using the review explorer.

- Fixed an issue with missing text in results for specific OS and browsers.

- Fixed an issue which could produce incorrect unresolved comment counts when updating the comment `is_resolved` state

- Fixed an issue in which the Dashboards page returned an error if the project had no tasks.

- Fixed an issue with project dashboard label distribution charts in which some labels could be improperly grouped.

- Fixed an issue where blank charts would be created in the project dashboards. 

- Fixed an issue in which project dashboard charts would return errors and appear empty.

- Fixed an issue is which the `TextArea` input area would resize while you were editing it.

- Fixed an issue with loading data manager while there are trailing special characters in keys of imported data.

- Fixed an issue where validation would fail for `<Table>` tags when the imported data used list format.

- Fixed an issue in which exporting data would use excessive memory.

- Fixed an issue in which some icons were not displayed correctly.

<div class="onprem-highlight">New ability to configure project-level roles, setting to hide the Cloud Storage page from Manager roles, other enhancements and bug fixes </div>

*Apr 09, 2024*

Helm Chart version: 1.4.2

### New features

#### Project-level roles

You can now assign the Reviewer or Annotator role to users on a per-project basis. This will help simplify team management and allow more flexibility for project managers within your organization to meet the needs of each project.  

This feature was previously only available to organizations who had enabled SCIM for their user management. Now, project-level roles can be assigned as part of the project membership settings, and is applicable to any user who has the Annotator or Reviewer role at the organization level. For example, a user can be an Annotator at the organization level, but have the Reviewer role for a specific project. Similarly, a user with the Reviewer role at the organization level can be assigned as an Annotator to different projects as needed. 

For more information, see [Project-level roles](#Project-level-roles).

![Screenshot of the project-level roles](/images/releases/2-11-0-project-level-roles.png)

### Enhancements

- Added support for `X-Api-Key: <token>` as an alternative to `Authentication: Token <token>`. This will make it easier to use API keys when integrating with cloud-based services. 
- Small UI improvement to make it clearer which project members are included in the project by default.
- There is a new setting in place that can control access to the Cloud Storage page for users with the Manager role. If you would like to enable this setting, set the `HIDE_STORAGE_SETTINGS_FOR_MANAGER` environment variable to `True`.
- Several enhancements for organizations with SCIM enabled, including:
    - More detailed error messages.
    - Allow workspace and role mappings to support multiple SCIM groups.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where Google Cloud Logging was not working due to a missing dependency.
- Fixed an issue where `/api/version` was not reporting all updates.
- Fixed an issue where, after revoking an invite to users who are already in projects, the project failed to load.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.10.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Granular API-level control over annotation history, UI enhancements for performance and user experience, security updates, bug fixes</div>

*Feb 13, 2024*

Helm chart version:  1.4.0

### Enhancements

- More granular API-level controls: 

    - Implemented datetime filtering to the per-project annotation history API to support analytics queries and reporting.  Now you can filter [`/api/projects/{id}/annotation-history`](https://app.heartex.com/docs/api/#tag/Annotation-History/operation/api_projects_annotation-history_list) by `created_at_from` and `created_at_to`.

- Made several updates to the UI to improve performance and user experience, including:

    - Better formatting for longer text strings when using the grid view in the Data Manager.

    - The Projects page is now limited to 12 projects per page, improving load time performance..

    - Added a confirmation message after deleting a user.


### Security

- Implemented comprehensive HTML sanitization to safeguard against vulnerabilities and ensure a secure user experience.

- This release includes several measures to increase SSRF protection, which address [`CVE-2023-47116`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-p59w-9gqw-wj8r):
    - When `SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED` is set to `true` (note that it defaults to `false`), our new default is to ban [all IPs within reserved blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses), for both IPv4 and IPv6.
    - We are introducing two new environment variables, to be used in conjunction with `SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED=true`:
        - `USER_ADDITIONAL_BANNED_SUBNETS` — Use this to specify additional IP addresses or CIDR blocks to ban from server-side requests (e.g. the URL-based file uploader).
        - `USE_DEFAULT_BANNED_SUBNETS` — This is set to `True` by default. If you would like to have full control over banned subnets, you can set this to `False` and use `USER_ADDITIONAL_BANNED_SUBNETS` to specify all the IP addresses/CIDR blocks you’d like to disallow instead.
    - We have also improved our error messages to make it clearer when an action is being blocked due to SSRF protections.


### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue with the Number tag in which the `max`  constraint was not working.

- Fixed an issue with the Number tag where `toName`  was not validated.

- Fixed an issue in which users were seeing an error when switching from task details to settings while working with a video annotation.

- Fixed an issue where comments that were entered but not submitted were preserved even when navigating between annotations. This could lead to users accidentally submitting comments they did not want to save.

- Fixed several issues where the refresh action was disabled depending on the selections that users would make when filtering for date and time ranges in the project dashboard.

- Fixed an issue where users were not shown a confirmation message after clicking **Submit and exit** in the label stream.

- Fixed an issue where Label Studio crashed when configuring multiple hotkeys using the `hotkey=","` format.

- Fixed an issue where annotation drafts were not saving when switching to view all mode.

- Fixed an issue where users would encounter an error when using the **Storage filename** filter in the Data Manager.

- Fixed an issue where relations were not displayed if they were added by a user while reviewing a task.

- Fixed an issue where the **Comments** tab was disappearing when users resized their screen.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.7.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">External taxonomy, group visibility in label distribution charts, soft delete users</div>

*Nov 21, 2023*

Helm chart version: 1.2.9

### New Features

#### External taxonomy

This release introduces the ability to load an external taxonomy into your labeling configuration. The mechanism for this is a new `apiUrl` parameter on the Taxonomy tag, which allows you to load your taxonomy from an external JSON-formatted file. Previously, you had to use `Choice` tags to manually define your taxonomy within the labeling configuration. 

This feature provides multiple benefits, including:

- **Performance** - Significant performance improvements for large taxonomies.
- **Usability and standardization** - With JSON formatting and the ability to manage taxonomies in your editor of choice, external taxonomies are easier to organize and update.
- **Security** - You can now securely store taxonomies outside of Label Studio.

Fore more information, see [Quickly Load and Manage Large-Scale Taxonomies From External Sources](https://humansignal.com/blog/new-quickly-load-and-manage-large-scale-taxonomies-from-external-sources/), the [Taxonomy template](https://docs.humansignal.com/templates/taxonomy), and [Taxonomy tag](https://docs.humansignal.com/tags/taxonomy). 

![Animated gif showing taxonomy in action](/images/releases/2-7-0-taxonomy.gif)

#### Group visibility in label distribution charts and drag-and-drop reordering

When a labeling configuration includes multiple label groups, you can now use the project dashboard to gain insight into label group performance.   

A new **Summary** view displays a donut chart showing label group distribution. This allows for more visibility into your labeling progress, and will help you identify areas within a project that might need additional task data.  

![Screenshot of label group distribution chart](/images/releases/2-7-0-label-groups.png)

You will also now be able to drag-and-drop the KPIs and charts to reorder them to your preference. 

For more information, see [Introducing Label Distribution Charts for Label Groups and User Soft Delete](https://humansignal.com/blog/introducing-label-distribution-charts-for-label-groups-and-user-soft-delete/). 

![Animated gif showing dashboard reordering](/images/releases/2-7-0-reorder.gif)

#### Soft delete users

Administrators can now delete users through the app or the API. This feature is intended to provide enhanced user management for administrators while minimizing potential security risks. 

Previously, administrators could only remove users by deactivating their account. However, this made it difficult to differentiate between users who are unlikely to return (such as a former employee) and users who might be temporarily inactive (such as freelance annotators). Now you can choose to either deactivate or delete a user. 

For more information, see [Introducing Label Distribution Charts for Label Groups and User Soft Delete](https://humansignal.com/blog/introducing-label-distribution-charts-for-label-groups-and-user-soft-delete/). 

![Screenshot of user delete action](/images/releases/2-7-0-user-delete.png)

### Enhancements

- Added support for AWS Signature Version 4 query parameters.
- The **Submitted Annotations** metric on project dashboards now includes a tooltip with additional information about skipped and empty annotations.

    ![Screenshot of tooltip on dashboard](/images/releases/2-7-0-tooltip.png)

### Security

- Fixed an SSRF DNS rebinding issue.
- Fixed an XSS vulnerability on certain error pages.
- Fixed an XSS vulnerability related to file extensions for avatars. This change addresses [`CVE-2023-47115`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-q68h-xwq5-mm7x).

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where a validation error was improperly displayed when setting the labeling configuration for a project.
- Fixed an issue with zoom performance in Image Segmentation cases.
- Fixed an issue where annotator performance dashboard agreements were incorrect.
- Fixed a run time error seen when syncing with Azure blob storage.
- Fixed an issue where tasks created through source storage were not triggering webhooks.

- Fixed an issue where draft annotations were not being saved before navigating away.
- Fixed an issue where `PATCH api/tasks/<id>` was returning an error.
- Fixed an issue where a duplicate project would incorrectly contain an annotation count with no annotations copied.
- Fixed an issue where agreement groundtruth API calls were using excess resources.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.6.0-2

<div class="onprem-highlight">Improved label and review stream counter</div>

*Oct 27, 2023*

### Enhancements

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.6.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">New <code>snap</code> parameter for KeyPoint, KeyPointLabels, Polygon, and PolygonLabels tags, improved usability when reviewing video in Outliner </div>

*Oct 24, 2023*

### Enhancements

- The [Keypoint](https://labelstud.io/tags/keypoint), [KeyPointLabels](https://docs.humansignal.com/tags/keypointlabels), [Polygon](https://docs.humansignal.com/tags/polygon), and [PolygonLabels](https://docs.humansignal.com/tags/polygonlabels) tags all support a new `snap` parameter for use in Image Segmentation labeling. When `snap="pixel"` is enabled, the (x, y) coordinates of each point are rounded to the pixel size. This enhancement will help ensure precise and uniform coordinates within images. For polygons, points are snapped to the pixel edge. For example, given a polygon point with the coordinates (0.25, 0.25), your resultant coordinates would snap to the edge of the pixel at (0,0). For keypoints, points are snapped to the pixel center.  For example, given a keypoint with the coordinates (0.25, 0.25), your resultant coordinates would snap to the center of the pixel at (0.5,0.5).
- When reviewing video in Outliner, if you click on a marked region, the video playback will automatically jump to the selected region. Previously, users had to manually scroll to the starting point. This change will make it easier to quickly view and edit video segments.

### Breaking changes

- This release adds a deployment-wide `VERIFY_SSL_CERTS` setting that defaults to `true`. Customers who are loading data (e.g. uploading tasks) from https URLs without verifiable SSL certificates must set `VERIFY_SSL_CERTS` to `false` in their environment variables before deploying Label Studio 2.6.0+.
- Add `WINDOWS_SQLITE_BINARY_HOST_PREFIX` environment variable to support hosting SQLite binaries on a server other than [sqlite.org](http://sqlite.org/), for Windows deployments running Python 3.8 only.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where pressing `Ctrl +` or `Ctrl -` (Windows) or `Cmd +` or `Cmd -` (Mac) was not zooming in/out on images as expected.
- Fixed an issue where the number of drafts displayed in the project summary was not updated when drafts were submitted as annotations.
- Fixed an issue where, in certain contexts, labeling instructions were displayed in raw HTML.
- Fixed an issue that occurred after project creation in which users were prevented from moving forward if changes were made in the template preview.
- Fixed an issue where AWS Lambdas custom agreement functions only worked for `Choice` tags.
- Fixed an issue where custom metrics for agreements weren’t working for annotations that had drafts.
- Fixed an issue where users were unable to navigate through their task list after saving a draft.
- Fixed an issue where, when viewing the Projects page, reviewers and managers were not seeing the total number of annotations in a project.
- Fixed an issue where blank drafts were being created when annotations were submitted.
- Fixed several issues with how annotation drafts were handled. Users will now see a more descriptive error message when trying to update a labeling configuration that is still being used in annotations or in drafts. Also, when using the Data Manager to delete all annotations, this will also delete all task drafts and annotation drafts.
- Fixed an issue where when duplicating a project that had cloud storage, the storage sync status and number of synced items was also copied when they should be reset.
- Fixed an issue of missing annotators from members dashboard when a performance optimization is enabled.
- Fixed an issue where `<Choice selected="true">` was not working within the `Taxonomy` tag.
- Fixed an issue that would cause a blank draft to be created when using hot-keyed annotation submit.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.5.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Project-level roles for SAML/SCIM, ability to pause annotation sessions</div>

*Sep 28, 2023*

### New features

- Project-level roles are now available and configurable through SAML or SCIM.  By mapping user groups to project roles, you'll have more granular access controls for your data and you can simplify permissions management for internal teams and annotators. For more information, see [the HumanSignal blog](https://humansignal.com/blog/manage-and-restrict-access-to-your-data-at-a-more-granular-level-with-project-based-roles/) and [the related documentation](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/scim_setup#Set-up-group-mapping). 

    ![Screenshot of SCIM mapping for project roles](/images/releases/2-5-0-project-roles.png)

- Users can now pause their annotation session so that they can take a break from annotating without it affecting their lead time scores. They can do this by selecting **Submit and Exit** or **Update and Exit**. Their work is automatically saved as a draft. For more information, see [Exit a labeling flow](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/labeling#Exiting-a-labeling-flow). 

    ![Screenshot of the Save and Exit option when labeling](/images/releases/2-5-0-submit-and-exit.png)

### Enhancements

- Improved performance of prediction counter calculations, leading to faster response times for project pages and stats calculations. 
- Improved dashboard load times, correcting an issue that caused projects with numerous different labels to timeout. 

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where attempting to access AWS target storage resulted in a 403 error. This was fixed by allowing prefix-level bucket access. 
- Fixed an issue where an XSS vulnerability meant that a user’s cookies could be exposed when viewing our API documentation. As a result, users must now be logged in when visiting the Label Studio Enterprise [API docs page](https://app.heartex.com/docs/api/) or the [Swagger page](https://app.heartex.com/swagger). 
- Fixed an issue where users’ changes to the Labeling Interface Settings were not being saved. 
- Fixed a performance issue when using mouse clicks to interact with OCR regions that have large numbers (>50) of bounding boxes. 
- Fixed an issue where Admin users who were assigned the Reviewer role in a project (using the SCIM project-role mapping) were seeing their own annotations in the review stream for the project. 
- Fixed an issue where organization-level roles rather than project-level roles were being reflected in project cards. 
- Fixed an issue to ensure that project-level role mapping is removed when the associated SCIM and SAML mappings are removed. 
- Fixed an issue with login page indexing that was preventing users from being added to projects. 
- Fixed an issue where the predictions counter was not correct when using project-level role mapping.

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.4.10

<div class="onprem-highlight">Contextual scrolling for audio and video, search field on the Projects page, autocomplete prompt when editing the labeling configuration</div>

*Sep 13, 2023*


### New features

- Contextual scrolling allows you to sync your text transcripts with their corresponding audio or video. When enabled, the text transcript automatically scrolls to the new listening point as the media plays. This is now the default mode for the Conversation Analysis template.
    
    For more information, see the [Contextual Scrolling template documentation](https://docs.humansignal.com/templates/contextual_scrolling).

    ![Screenshot of an audio file with contextual scrolling](/images/releases/2-4-10-scrolling.png)
    
- There is a new search field on the Projects page. You can use this field to search project titles. It can also be used with the project filters. For more information, see [Search projects](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/manage_projects#Search-projects). 

    ![Screenshot of the search field on the Projects page](/images/releases/2-4-10-search.png)

- When working with the labeling configuration code editor, you will now see an autocomplete prompt that lists and defines possible tags and parameters. 

    ![Screenshot of the autocomplete feature in action](/images/releases/2-4-10-autocomplete.png)
    
- You can now use the API to filter [projects by title](https://app.heartex.com/docs/api/#tag/Projects/operation/api_projects_list). 
- There is a new **Drafts** column available in the Data Manager. You can also filter and sort by this column.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Drafts column in the Data Manager](/images/releases/2-4-10-drafts.png)

### Enhancements

- When using an LLM-based ML backend, the `<TextArea>` tag now supports chat mode. You can send a prompt and receive a response to populate your TextArea inputs. 
- New tooltips throughout the UI provide guidance on advanced features and configurations to improve labeling efficiency and quality. 
- Label distribution now shows the number of labels instead of the percentage. 
- Deactivated user pages now include contact information. 
- For organizations using SSO, you can now disable regular logins for your users. 
- The project migration script has been improved to ensure that annotation history, annotation reviews, and drafts are migrated appropriately.

- Improved exact frames matching, including adjusting BBox impact weight and improved basic matching for more accurate consensus scores. 
- Several design improvements to project dashboards:
    - Progress bars are now clearer. 
    - Task Pending Review and Annotated Tasks indicators now have labels for better clarity. 

### Security

This release addresses a vulnerability regarding how SECRET_KEY is set.

- The SECRET_KEY is now configurable through an environment variable. **Users are strongly encouraged to set SECRET_KEY to a random secret of their choosing.** A fallback SECRET_KEY is specified by default, but will be removed in a future version.
- Older versions also included a vulnerability in which the secret key could be leaked via identity provider callbacks. This release patches that vulnerability.
- **Helm Chart update**: Version 1.2.0 is now available. This version includes automatic generation of a random SECRET_KEY, which also populates a Kubernetes secret. No manual setting required. [See the full changelog here](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/CHANGELOG.md).

## Label Studio Enterprise 2.2.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">SCIM 2.0 support, rotating bounding boxes, 'Last updated by' column in the Data Manager, ability to navigate to the previous task </div>

This section highlights the new features and enhancements in Label Studio Enterprise 2.2.0.

### New features and enhancements 
Label Studio Enterprise 2.2.0 introduces the following new features and enhancements.

- Label Studio Enterprise 2.2.0 introduces the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) version 2.0 standard. System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is a popular protocol to manage access for services and applications across an organization. Use the [SCIM guide](scim_setup.html) to set up SCIM integration to manage access to Label Studio Enterprise in your organization.


   <i>Check the following video tutorial about SCIM and Okta setup.</i>

- Starting with this release, as an annotator you can create a rotated bounding box with the "three point click" or "two point click" feature to annotate images.  

    - First point click - Starting point of the location to draw the bounding box.
    - Second point click - Define the rotation and width of the bounding box.
    - Third point click - Draw the height of the bounding box.

    <br>
    <div style="margin:auto; text-align:center;"><img src="/images/two-point-click.png" style="opacity: 0.8"/></div>
    <i>Figure 1: Two point click rectangle.</i>

    <div style="margin:auto; text-align:center;"><img src="/images/three-point-click.png" style="opacity: 0.8"/></div>
    <i>Figure 2: Three point click rectangle.</i>

    After you create the bounding box, you can do the following: 
    - Adjust it by moving the anchors or edges to the desired location on the canvas.
    - Determine that the orientation of the bounding box is effected.
    - See the orientation of the bounding box and determine the direction during the creation process.

- This release includes the `Last updated by` column in **Data Manager** with information of `updated_at` - `updated_by`, annotator/reviewer (the person who made the last modifications for any of the annotations in this task) at `updated_at` time.

    <i>Figure 3: "Last updated by" column in Data Manager.</i>

- This release introduces the go-back functionality (`<` icon) that allows you to navigate back to the previous task through the review stream.
